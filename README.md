# TIC-TAC-TOE
Tic Tac Toe is a simple, yet classic two-player strategy game, traditionally played with a pencil and paper. The game consists of a 3x3 grid, and players take turns marking spaces within this grid, aiming to be the first to align three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
